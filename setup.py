	long_description='\n**Note**: This package has been built automatically by\n`zero2pypi <http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/zero2pypi.xml>`_.\nIf possible, you should use the zero-install feed instead:\nhttp://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/autonose.xml\n\n----------------\n\nAutonose\n========\n\nAutonose is an autotest-like tool for python, using the excellent nosetest\nlibrary.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Re-run tests instantly when you save a file\n- Re-runs only tests that have failed or depend on changed files\n- GTK GUI (console fallback for other platforms or by passing in --console)\n- focus mode: keep running a single test (GUI only)\n\nTo activate focus mode, click the large grey circle next to the test result.\nTo go back to normal mode, click the "#" in the status bar (next to the\nnumber of tests run).\n\nNote: on a Mac, to get immediate filesystem notification you may need to install\nwatchdog using ``easy_install``, as it needs to compile a native extension which\nisn\'t included in the 0install package.\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\nThe officially supported installation mechanism is zero install. You will\nneed the zeroinstall-injector package (from apt, yum, macports, etc.) or\n`your platform\'s equivalent <http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/injector.html>`_.\n\nTo launch it, simply run::\n\n\t$ 0launch http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/autonose.xml\n\nYou can also use 0alias to make a short name for it::\n\n\t$ 0alias autonose http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/autonose.xml\n\t$ autonose\n\nIf you have modified the code, you will want to create a local feed to run::\n\n\t$ 0launch http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/0local.xml autonose.xml\n\t$ 0launch autonose-local.xml\n\nSee http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/autonose.xml for further deatils.\n\nIf you really *must* use pypi, you can ``pip install autonose``.\n\nAdvanced use:\n-------------\n\nnosetests has a lot of options and plugins. autonose tries to work as best\nit can with them, but be warned that some plugins will interfere with autonose\n(particularly any that do their own output or manage test results).\n\nHowever, you can pass any options you want to nose by prefixing them with ``-x``,\nor by using ``--config=nose.cfg`` if you have a config file.\n(e.g. to turn on doctest, you should pass ``-x--with-doctest`` to autonose)\n\nNotes:\n------\n\nAutotest does not (currently):\n\n- understand dynamic imports (use of ``__import__``)\n- track any file types other than ``.py``\n',
